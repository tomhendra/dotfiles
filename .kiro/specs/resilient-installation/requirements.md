# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The resilient installation feature enhances the existing dotfiles installation script to be more robust, recoverable, and reliable. This system ensures that the developer environment setup can handle failures gracefully, provide clear feedback, support resumption from failure points, and validate successful installation across different macOS environments.

## Glossary

- **Installation_System**: The complete dotfiles installation and configuration system including install.sh and related scripts
- **Recovery_Mechanism**: The system's ability to resume installation from the point of failure without repeating successful steps
- **Validation_System**: The automated verification that all components are correctly installed and configured
- **Progress_Tracker**: The component that tracks and persists installation progress across script executions
- **Dependency_Checker**: The component that validates prerequisites before attempting installation steps
- **Rollback_System**: The mechanism to undo partial installations when failures occur

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer setting up a new Mac, I want the installation to be resilient to network failures, so that temporary connectivity issues don't force me to restart the entire setup process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network operation fails, THE Installation_System SHALL retry the operation up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN network operations continue to fail after retries, THE Installation_System SHALL log the failure and continue with offline-capable operations
3. WHEN network connectivity is restored, THE Installation_System SHALL resume failed network operations automatically
4. WHERE network operations are critical, THE Installation_System SHALL provide clear instructions for manual completion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the installation to resume from where it left off after a failure, so that I don't have to repeat time-consuming steps that already completed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Installation_System SHALL maintain a progress state file that tracks completed installation steps
2. WHEN the installation script is re-executed, THE Installation_System SHALL read the progress state and skip completed steps
3. WHEN a step fails, THE Installation_System SHALL mark only that step as failed while preserving the status of completed steps
4. THE Installation_System SHALL provide a command-line option to reset progress state and start fresh
5. WHEN resuming installation, THE Installation_System SHALL validate that previously completed steps are still in a valid state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive validation of the installation, so that I can be confident my development environment is correctly configured before I start working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Installation_System SHALL validate each installation step immediately after completion
2. THE Installation_System SHALL provide a standalone validation command that checks the entire environment
3. WHEN validation fails, THE Installation_System SHALL provide specific remediation steps for each failure
4. THE Installation_System SHALL verify that all symlinks point to valid files
5. THE Installation_System SHALL confirm that all installed tools are executable and functional

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear progress feedback during installation, so that I understand what's happening and can estimate completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Installation_System SHALL display a progress indicator showing completed and remaining steps
2. THE Installation_System SHALL provide estimated time remaining based on typical step durations
3. WHEN a step is running, THE Installation_System SHALL show the current operation being performed
4. THE Installation_System SHALL log all operations to a detailed log file for troubleshooting
5. WHEN errors occur, THE Installation_System SHALL display both user-friendly messages and technical details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the installation to handle existing configurations gracefully, so that running the script on a partially configured system doesn't break existing setups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Installation_System SHALL detect existing installations and configurations before making changes
2. WHEN existing configurations are found, THE Installation_System SHALL prompt for user confirmation before overwriting
3. THE Installation_System SHALL backup existing configurations before replacing them
4. WHERE configurations are identical, THE Installation_System SHALL skip the installation step
5. THE Installation_System SHALL provide options to merge or preserve existing custom configurations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the installation to verify prerequisites upfront, so that I'm notified of missing requirements before the installation begins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Installation_System SHALL check all system requirements before starting any installation steps
2. WHEN prerequisites are missing, THE Installation_System SHALL provide specific installation instructions for each missing component
3. THE Installation_System SHALL verify sufficient disk space for all planned installations
4. THE Installation_System SHALL check macOS version compatibility for all tools and applications
5. THE Installation_System SHALL validate that the user has necessary permissions for all planned operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ability to install only specific components, so that I can customize my setup or fix individual parts without running the entire installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Installation_System SHALL provide command-line options to install specific components or categories
2. THE Installation_System SHALL support dry-run mode that shows what would be installed without making changes
3. WHEN installing specific components, THE Installation_System SHALL automatically include required dependencies
4. THE Installation_System SHALL provide options to exclude specific components from a full installation
5. THE Installation_System SHALL maintain component dependency information to prevent broken installations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic rollback capability when installations fail, so that my system isn't left in a broken state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a critical installation step fails, THE Installation_System SHALL automatically rollback changes made in the current session
2. THE Installation_System SHALL maintain rollback information for each installation step
3. THE Installation_System SHALL provide a manual rollback command to undo the last installation attempt
4. WHEN rolling back, THE Installation_System SHALL restore backed-up configurations and remove partially installed components
5. THE Installation_System SHALL verify system state after rollback operations
