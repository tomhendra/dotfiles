# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The tomdot refactor consolidates the resilient installation functionality into a clean, maintainable architecture while preserving the perfected Rock.js-inspired CLI styling. This refactor addresses the current file proliferation and creates a focused, production-ready dotfiles installation system.

## Glossary

- **Tomdot_Installer**: The CLI installation software that sets up a complete macOS React Native development environment on fresh macOS installations
- **CLI_Framework**: The Rock.js-inspired user interface library that provides beautiful progress indicators and styling
- **Installation_Engine**: The core resilient installation functionality with state management and retry logic
- **Legacy_Files**: The current install.sh and existing dotfiles structure that must be preserved
- **Helper_Libraries**: The useful functionality in lib/ that should be consolidated rather than duplicated

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean, consolidated codebase, so that the tomdot project is maintainable and not cluttered with experimental files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL consolidate all resilient installation functionality into a single primary library file
2. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL remove all duplicate, experimental, and demo files that don't serve the production system
3. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL use consistent naming conventions that reflect the tomdot project identity
4. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL maintain only essential files needed for the production installation system
5. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL preserve the existing dotfiles structure and configuration files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve the beautiful Rock.js-inspired CLI styling, so that the installation experience remains polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CLI_Framework SHALL maintain the exact visual styling demonstrated in simple_rock_demo.sh which uses lib/simple_rock.sh
2. THE CLI_Framework SHALL preserve the diamond symbols (◇) and connecting lines (│) throughout the installation flow exactly as shown in the working demo
3. THE CLI_Framework SHALL maintain the color scheme and visual hierarchy that matches Rock.js aesthetics as implemented in lib/simple_rock.sh
4. THE CLI_Framework SHALL preserve the bordered box functionality for displaying next steps exactly as demonstrated
5. THE CLI_Framework SHALL ensure consistent visual flow from questions through execution to completion as perfected in the demo
6. THE CLI_Framework SHALL enhance the loading indicator from static "..." to an animated spinner that works reliably across terminal types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced install.sh to replace the current version, so that I get resilient installation with beautiful UI for my dotfiles setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Installation_Engine SHALL enhance the current install.sh in-place with resilient functionality while maintaining the same filename and entry point
2. THE Installation_Engine SHALL implement all the actual dotfiles installation steps (SSH setup, Homebrew, symlinks, etc.)
3. THE Installation_Engine SHALL provide state persistence so installations can resume after failures
4. THE Installation_Engine SHALL include retry logic for network operations and temporary failures
5. THE Installation_Engine SHALL backup existing configurations before making changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to consolidate useful helper functionality, so that I have validation, recovery, and configuration management without code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL integrate useful functionality from existing helper libraries into the main framework
2. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL provide validation capabilities to verify successful installation
3. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL include recovery mechanisms for handling installation failures
4. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL support configuration management with conflict resolution
5. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL eliminate duplicate code across multiple library files

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple project structure, so that the codebase follows KISS and DRY principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL follow the principle of "Keep It Simple, Stupid" by minimizing complexity
2. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL follow the principle of "Don't Repeat Yourself" by eliminating duplicate functionality
3. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL maintain a clear separation of concerns between UI, installation logic, and helper functions
4. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL use meaningful file names that reflect the tomdot project identity
5. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL maintain install.sh as the single entry point while adding resilient features internally

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve backward compatibility, so that existing dotfiles functionality continues to work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL maintain compatibility with existing dotfiles structure and configuration files
2. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL preserve all current installation capabilities while adding resilient features
3. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL ensure that install.sh maintains the same entry point for the curl command (curl -ssL https://git.io/tomdot | sh)
4. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL maintain existing command-line interface expectations
5. THE Tomdot_Installer SHALL preserve the ability to run installation steps individually when needed
